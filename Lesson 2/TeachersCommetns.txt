Well done!

a) -0.25
The condition was not "not equal", it was "not including".
Also, if it's asked to show COUNT, then it would be more correct to have COUNT in the SELECT.

e) -0.75
Color is not asked in the select and it will lead to cancel it in th GROUP BY.
Also, NULL should be compared only with the "IS NOT NULL" filter.
